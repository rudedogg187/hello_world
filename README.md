git tutorial for CS464

Huggie Bear here, I like D3.js and hoppy IPAs (they go well together).
I ate a taco for dinner tonight, I added habenero salsa to it.  Far superior to mild salsa.
I like cats.  I like cats so much that I have three cats.  
My cats are old an throw up a lot.  I'm begining to not like cats so much.

Over and out good buddy, want a cat?
